# Production_Dashboard_Excel
This project presents a well-structured Excel-based dashboard designed to analyze and visualize key production performance indicators. The dashboard utilizes standard Microsoft Excel tools such as pivot tables, slicers, and a variety of chart types to deliver insights on production cost, output trends, departmental efficiency, and demographic filters.

Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an interactive and insightful dashboard that enables users to:

Understand total and average production costs across product categories

Analyze shift-wise and date-wise production trends

Monitor task allocation across managers

Compare product-wise production efficiency

Use demographic filters (region, gender, age group, and quarter) for targeted analysis

Dashboard Components
1. Total Production Cost by Product Type
A 3D column chart displays the total cost incurred for different product categories including Automobiles, Electronics, Furniture, and Machinery.

Key observations:

Automobiles have the highest total production cost

Electronics contribute the least in terms of cost

2. Number of Tasks by Manager
A horizontal bar chart represents the number of production tasks handled by individual managers.

Key insights:

Nancy Grey has managed the highest number of tasks

David White has the least task count

3. Number of Units Produced by Date
A line chart shows the trend of units produced over a 13-month period, allowing time-series analysis.

Key insights:

Highest production occurred in November 2023

A gradual decline is observed over mid to late 2024

4. Average Production Cost per Unit by Product Type
A 2D area chart visualizes the average unit cost for each product type.

Key insights:

Furniture has the highest average cost per unit

Electronics are the most cost-effective in terms of unit cost

5. Filter Components (Slicers)
The dashboard includes slicers to allow dynamic filtering based on:

Region: East, West, North, South

Gender: Male, Female, Unknown

Age Group: A1, A2, A3

Quarter: Q1 to Q4, and custom date ranges

These filters enhance user interactivity and enable focused analysis for specific groups or time periods.


2D and 3D charts for visualization

Data formatting and conditional styling for clarity

Key Findings
Product categories show varied trends in total and per-unit cost

Managerial workload distribution is uneven, with one manager handling significantly more tasks

Production trends exhibit a seasonal pattern, with peaks and troughs over time

Furniture, though costliest per unit, may require deeper analysis for profitability

Demographic filters enable granular insights useful for decision-makers
